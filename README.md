# Video Demo
# Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install Dependencies
Ensure you've cloned this repository, and have node installed.
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

Will install `node_modules` according to dependencies listed in `package.json`

### `python app.py`
or `python3` depending on your version/interpreter/PATH.

Will start the Flask server, **by default** on http://127.0.0.1:5000. The React web app will not be functional if the server isn't running.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### If the Flask server and/or React app open on different ports on your device than the ones listed here, please modify the appropriate lines in both the `app.py` and `App.js` files (they will be near the top).
